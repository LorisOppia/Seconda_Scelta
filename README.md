## Prerequisites

You should have these installed on your OS.

- Node.js
- Yarn ($ npm i -g yarn)
- Ionic CLI ($ yarn global add ionic/cli)
- Android Studio
- Xcode (Mac only)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn add:device`

Adds a native build folder for a specific device (android or ios).

### `yarn sync`

Build and copy project files and assets and sync it with the native device directory.

### `yarn open`

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn start:device`

Runs the app in the development mode on a physical device (android or ios).

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
